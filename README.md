This project is about redesigning a pantomime theatre website (pantomima.az). The website is made by combining different css layout techniques (flexbox, grid) responsive on 3 different screen-sizes (break points:600px, 1200px) and bilingual. The links to different pages are not working at the moment. 
To start the programm run 'python (or python3) manage.py runserver' in 'pantomimeweb' directory, where manage.py is located.
To add/edit new shows go to '/admin', credentials: usern: leman, passw: laman12345
